## Introduction
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#introduction)

- What is JavaScript?
- History and versioning
- Relationships to HTML and CSS
- Editor setup (those taking standalone course)
- Publishing to Netlify
- **Instructor-led exercise**:
<br>*Together, we will write JS to take text input from the user, modify it and display it back.*


## Values, Variables, and Types
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#values-variables-and-types)
- Values existing on their own
- Variables pointing to single values
- Variables pointing to groups of values
- JS types
- Object literals
- Object property referencing
- Copying references
- JS keywords `const`, `let`, `var`
- Numbers and operators
- Strings and operators
- Template (String) literals
- Type coercion
- The four types of equality
- **Instructor-led exercise**:
<br>*Quiz, using prompt(), String to Number coercion, and strict equality*.


## Functions and Program Flow
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#functions)

- Function declarations
- Function expressions
- When to use either
- Function scope and local variables
- Function composition
- Logical expressions and operators
- Conditional statements
- Collections (arrays)
- Iterative statements (loops)
- Array methods
- Error handling
- [**Assignment - Random Story Generator** ](#)
<br>*based on [MDN](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/assessment-finished/).*


## Timing, Referencing and Events
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#timing-referencing-and-events)

- Script placement
- On-event listeners
- AddEventListener()
- Common event types
- **Instructor-led exercise - TBC:**
<br>*xx.*
- [**Assignment - Dialler**](#) ****available as extension exercise***
<br>*PART 1: create a telephone keypad. <br>**Part 2:** TBC - debounce repeated key presses?*


## Browser-Based JS and The DOM
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#the-window-object)

- DOM referencing
- NodeList & HTMLCollection
- Creating elements and attributes
- Leveraging the `classList` element property
- [**Assignment - TODO list**](#)
<br>*Construct a TODO list dynamically on user interaction.*

<hr>

## Object-Oriented Programming With Prototypes and Classes
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#dynamic-html)

- xx
- **Instructor-led exercise: TODO**
<br>*We will make a dynamic TODO list app in vanilla JS.*


## Functional Programming With Immutable Transformations 
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#prototypes-and-classes)

- xx
- **Instructor-led exercise: TODO**
<br>*We will make a dynamic TODO list app in vanilla JS.*


## Window Object APIs
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#api-calls)

- xx
- [**Assignment - Random Jokes**](#)
<br>*Make jokes app to connect to a random jokes API and display the result back in the DOM.*


## Scope and Closures
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#scope-and-closures)

- More on function scope
- **Instructor-led exercise**:
<br>*TBC*.
- [**Assignment - scope and closures**](#)
<br>*TBC.*

## Functional Array Transformations
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#functional-array-transformations)

- More array methods
- [**Assignment - Video Catalogue**](#) ****available as extension exercise***
<br>*Take a supplied list of videos, titles, categories and timings, and devise four functions to present different views of the data accordingly. Do not change the original list.*



## Server-Based JS, Node, and Project Build Tools 
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#asynchronous)

- xx:
- [**Assignment - Node.JS**](#)
<br>*Build a basic web server in Node, with a custom module. Deploy to NPM registry from GitHub.*


## Asynchronous Programming With Fetch and  Promises 
[Recommended reading](recommended-reading.md#asynchronous-programming-with-fetch-and-promises)

- xx:
- [**Assignment - PWA**](#)
<br>*Build a Progressive Web App from scratch using your web server from the last exercise and no frameworks just vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.*
